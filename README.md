# Enhanced Automated Indoor Hydroponic System

This project presents the development of an enhanced automated indoor hydroponic system using a Raspberry Pi to tackle issues related to water use, soil management, and food insecurity in manual farming.

## Objectives

1. **Solar-Powered Automated Indoor Hydroponics System**
   - Develop a system powered by solar energy to automate indoor hydroponics.

2. **Web Application for Monitoring and Control**
   - Create a web application to monitor water and air quality parameters using various sensors.
   - Control grow lights, mists, and pumps through the web application.
   - Parameters monitored include:
     - pH level
     - Temperature
     - Electrical conductivity
     - Humidity

3. **Evaluation of Growth Rate and Yield**
   - Evaluate the growth rate (height, number of leaves, and head mass) and yield of the enhanced system.
   - Compare the performance with existing hydroponics systems.

## Components

- **Raspberry Pi:** The central controller for the system.
- **Sensors:** Used to measure pH levels, temperature, electrical conductivity, and humidity.
- **Solar Panels:** Provide power to the system.
- **Web Application:** Interface for monitoring and controlling the system.
- **Actuators:**
  - Grow Lights
  - Mists
  - Pumps

## System Overview

The enhanced automated indoor hydroponic system integrates various technologies to provide a sustainable and efficient farming solution. The Raspberry Pi acts as the brain of the system, interfacing with multiple sensors to gather data on environmental conditions. This data is then used to automate the control of lights, mists, and pumps, ensuring optimal growing conditions for the plants. The use of solar power enhances the sustainability of the system.

The web application serves as a user-friendly interface, allowing users to monitor real-time data and control the system remotely. This setup not only improves efficiency but also reduces the labor and resources required for manual farming.

## Evaluation

The system's performance will be evaluated by measuring the growth rate and yield of plants. Key metrics include the height of the plants, the number of leaves, and the head mass. These metrics will be compared against those from traditional hydroponics systems to demonstrate the improvements brought by the enhanced system.

## Conclusion

By automating indoor hydroponics with solar power and advanced monitoring, this project aims to address critical challenges in modern farming, offering a solution that is both sustainable and efficient.
